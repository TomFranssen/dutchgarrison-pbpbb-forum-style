# How to compile SCSS to CSS 

Make sure you install the following tools:
* NodeJS with NPM: https://nodejs.org

## Steps to compile to CSS:
* Go to the /theme folder
* Run npm install (this will install the modules listed in package.json)
* Run gulp sass to compile css code once
* Run gulp watch to keep watching for SCSS changes

Be sure to deploy the generated CSS :-)
